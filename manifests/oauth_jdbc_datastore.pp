# Class: pingfederate::oauth_jdbc_datastore
#
# Configure the oauth JDBC datastore only if oauth_jdbc_type is set.
# The JDBC JAR files and database DDL initialization were done in install.pp
#
# Unfortunately the 'clean' way to do this is to invoke the pf-admin-api to add the database connector
# and then edit two XML files, adding the JNDI-NAME to one of them, which requires restarting the
# service.
#
# The --json file is input to the pf-admin-api POST to define a new JDBC datastore.
# If it appears for the first time (or changes), that triggers invoking the API.
# The --response file is the response from the POST.
# It is also used on subsequent invocations to get the 'id' in order to do a GET/PUT
# to update the existing resource (e.g. for a password change).
#
# Note that the admin API tries to connect to the database to confirm it is available.
